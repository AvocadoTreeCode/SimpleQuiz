# SimpleQuiz
A simple quiz I coded which ask the user basic Java questions.  It utilizes for, if, and while loops. 
It will also have an object called Questions which is utilized to set the questions and answers on the main class.
The while loop is used to execute and start the quiz when the user inputs the ENTER key.
It is important to remember that a while loop will continue to execute until it is proven false.
